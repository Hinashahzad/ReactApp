The files in the folder datepicker-css were not written by us. The were 
written by HackerOne, and released under the MIT license. These files 
were placed here because is was the only way to ensure they were 
accessed correctly by the TimePicker components, which were created by 
us. The files are used to style our components.
You can find the documentation for the react-datepicker
(which is where these files were taken from) here:
